```go
{
    ID:               "amz_XX",
    Marketplace:      "AMAZON",
    Title:            "Product Name",
    ImageURL:         "https://images.unsplash.com/...",
    Price:            99.99,
    Currency:         "USD",
    Rating:           4.5,

    Description:      "Product description...",
